    <h1>If possible, try any of these hikes while in the area. They could be hard with the altitude, but they're well worth it!</h1>
 
    <h2>Pikes Peak</h2>
	<p>One of the most famous mountains in Colorado, Pikes Peak offers multiple ways to ascend. Some routes offer shorter paths up the mountain, but the most famous Barr Trail is an impresive 13 miles one way! If 13 miles sounds way too extreme, driving all the way up the summit is also an option.</p>
